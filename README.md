# Mullvad Browser - Twilight Style Dark UI Mod

A simple mod that gives **Mullvad Browser** a **Twilight-style dark gray theme** for the **tab bar** and **navigation bar**, keeping everything else unchanged. It enhances visibility, provides subtle contrast, and maintains a clean, modern look.

## Features

- **Twilight-style dark gray color** for the tab bar and navigation bar.
- **Clear text and icons** (white for visibility).
- **Slightly darker inactive tabs** for contrast.
- **Subtle rounded corners** for a smoother look.
- **Thin border effect** to separate the UI from the page.
